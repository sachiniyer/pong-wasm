# Pong + [Candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle)

This project implements pong with a wasm based machine learning model to learn with RL and policy gradients in real time. However, there are major performance issues from making this reasonable to use (mostly around IndexedDb) - but all the code works!

If you want to try it out go to TBD
